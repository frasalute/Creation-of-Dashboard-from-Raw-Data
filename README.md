# Creation-of-Dashboard-from-Raw-Data

This project aims to enhance the understanding of Airbnb guestsâ€™ preferences and ultimately in- crease guest satisfaction. It provides insights for management and corresponding business recom- mendations based on an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and a dashboard. The report provides detailed information about the methods used, an in-depth discussion of the findings, as well as clear business recommendations. The dashboard provides condensed information for management, facilitating decision-making to increase guest satisfaction.
The workflow of data cleaning before exporting the data to SQL consisted of getting an overview, creating a data dictionary, converting data types, and replacing invalid values. Subsequently, the data was exported to PostgreSQL, and used for building the dashboard. Further preprocessing steps for the EDA consisted of handling missing values, dropping duplicates and unnecessary columns, performing additional transformations on the data, and developing additional attributes.
