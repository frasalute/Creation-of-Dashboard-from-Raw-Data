# Creation-of-Dashboard-from-Raw-Data

(Done in a university setting as project part of a Data Management and Visualization class together with other three students.)

# Executive Summary
This project aims to enhance the understanding of Airbnb guestsâ€™ preferences and ultimately in- crease guest satisfaction. It provides insights for management and corresponding business recom- mendations based on an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and a dashboard. 

The report provides detailed information about the methods used, an in-depth discussion of the findings, as well as clear business recommendations. 

The dashboard provides condensed information for management, facilitating decision-making to increase guest satisfaction.

The workflow of data cleaning before exporting the data to SQL consisted of getting an overview, creating a data dictionary, converting data types, and replacing invalid values. Subsequently, the data was exported to PostgreSQL, and used for building the dashboard. 

Further preprocessing steps for the EDA consisted of handling missing values, dropping duplicates and unnecessary columns, performing additional transformations on the data, and developing additional attributes.

Facilitating decision-making concerning guest satisfaction, the business recommendations are re- flected in the dashboard design. The dashboard is divided into the Overview, Host, and Neigh- borhood sections, each with its visualisations and functionalities, tailored to the information to be conveyed.
